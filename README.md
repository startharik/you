# Pixel YouTube Clone

This project is a YouTube clone built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. You can set it up locally using XAMPP. Ensure you download `ffmpeg` as it is required to get the duration and thumbnails of the videos. Make sure to update the path for `ffmpeg` wherever required.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install XAMPP on your local machine.
2. Download `ffmpeg` and ensure it is accessible in your system's PATH.
3. Create a folder named `videos` in the root directory of the project.
4. Inside the `videos` folder, create another folder named `thumbnails`.
5. Clone or download the project files into your XAMPP's `htdocs` directory.
6. Start the Apache and MySQL servers using XAMPP Control Panel.
7. Import the provided MySQL database into your local MySQL server.
8. Update the database configuration in the PHP files (`db.php`, `video.php`, etc.) with your MySQL credentials.
9. You may need to configure the `.htaccess` file to enable clean URLs (if applicable).
10. Access the website in your browser to view the YouTube clone.
